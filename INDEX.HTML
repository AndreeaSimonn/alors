    <h2>Academic Concept Project | Planned Launch: 2026</h2>
    <p><em>Created by Andreea Simon</em></p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For this academic concept project, I developed a full launch strategy for a limited-edition <strong>streetwear capsule collection</strong> for Alo Yoga, with a planned campaign rollout in 2026. I chose Alo Yoga because of its growing influence in the Gen Z market and its successful evolution from fitness wear into fashion-forward, lifestyle-driven streetwear. My objective was to build a fully integrated <strong>multi-channel campaign</strong> that would create excitement, drive product interest, and deliver a sense of exclusivity both online and in person.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The campaign begins with a <strong>pre-launch phase</strong> focused on creating buzz and anticipation. I designed teaser content ideas for TikTok and Instagram Reels that would feature influencers styling unreleased pieces, with subtle hints about the drop. These posts would build curiosity while allowing the brand to tap into current trends. I also planned for PR boxes to be sent to Alo ambassadors ahead of the drop, encouraging them to film authentic unboxings and “first look” videos. To drive conversion and prepare the audience, I proposed a countdown system using Instagram Stories with tappable reminders that would alert followers when the drop goes live.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>During <strong>launch week</strong>, the campaign would shift to high-impact engagement. The capsule would be released through a dedicated Shopify microsite optimized for mobile-first shopping. The core of the digital strategy would center around a branded hashtag campaign called <strong>#AloMovesYou</strong>, inviting Gen Z creators to show how they style the collection in their everyday lives—through movement, dance, workouts, or casual city wear. At the same time, <strong>in-person pop-up activations</strong> would take place in major cities like New York and Los Angeles. These immersive events would include styling booths, DJ sets, photo backdrops, and giveaway opportunities, offering the audience a chance to connect with the brand in real life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In the <strong>post-launch phase</strong>, I planned to maintain momentum by amplifying user-generated content across Alo Yoga’s channels. Customers and creators would be reshared to showcase real-life styling moments, creating a sense of community and validation. Behind-the-scenes content would highlight the making of the capsule, with short-form videos explaining the design process and sustainable materials used. To reignite urgency, I scheduled a surprise “24-hour only” restock alert one week later—designed to bring the brand back into the feed and boost second-wave engagement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To keep the campaign organized and effective, I developed a <strong>4-week launch calendar</strong>, outlining specific platform actions, influencer release dates, and event touchpoints. I also created a visual deck in PowerPoint that includes a timeline, sample content, and visual direction for the campaign.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This project helped me grow as a strategist and creative planner. I learned how to blend brand storytelling with real-world execution, and how to design a launch that speaks to Gen Z values—authenticity, creativity, exclusivity, and movement. If given the opportunity, I’d apply this same strategic thinking to real campaigns in the fashion and fitness space.</p>
